Welcome to Atlas-C++, the C++ reference implementation of the Atlas protocol. The Atlas protocol is the primary protocol by which servers and clients in the [WorldForge](http://worldforge.org/ "The main Worldforge site") system communicate.

## Installation

If you intend to build this as a prerequisite for the Ember client or the Cyphesis server we strongly suggest that you use the [Hammer](http://wiki.worldforge.org/wiki/Hammer_Script "The Hammer script") tool to compile it. This is script provided by the Worldforge project which will download and install all of the required libraries and components used by Worldforge.

Alternatively you can use [Conan](https://www.conan.io) to install all dependencies.

```bash
conan remote add worldforge https://artifactory.ogenvik.org/artifactory/api/conan/conan
conan install tools/conan --build missing
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
```

Otherwise the library can most easily be built through the following commands.
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j all install
```

### Tests

The test suite can be built and run using the ```check``` target. For example:

```bash
make check
```

or 

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target check
```

### API documentation

If Doxygen is available API documentation can be generated using the ```dox``` target. For example:

```bash
make dox
```

or 

```bash
cmake --build --preset conan-release --target dox
```

## Version

This is Atlas-C++ 0.7.x, the latest development version of Atlas-C++. The 0.6.x branch will contain NO API CHANGES. The 0.7.x branch is completely experimental and may not be easy to track. Any changes affecting the API should go into 0.7.x, as should any features which are not completely stable.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation, simply configure the tree then execute the "docs" target (for example ```make docs```). This will use doxygen to generate the documentation, which will then reside in doc/.

Please read the file HACKING.md carefully before working on Atlas-C++.

## The specification

The actual Atlas specification can be found under ```protocol/spec``` as a series of filed ending in the ".def" suffix. These files represent the canonical Atlas definition.

In order to generate the C++ code these files are translated into a ```protocol/spec/xml/atlas.xml``` file through the use of the ```protocol/spec/tools/def2xml.py``` file, which requires Python. Normally this would be performed by the CMake build script.

This file (```protocol/spec/xml/atlas.xml```) in turn gets translated into C++ files through the use of the ```Atlas/Objects/gen_cpp.py``` Python script (which requires Python).This would also normally be performed by the CMake build script.

Thus, in order to change the protocol one would perform these steps:

* Update any of the files in ```protocol/spec```
* Rebuild the project (through the builder used with CMake)

You shouldn't touch the ```protocol/spec/xml/atlas.xml``` file, nor any of the C++ files generated (these are identified by having "Automatically generated using gen_cpp.py." added to the top of them).

There are some areas of improvements here. Chief amongst them would be

* Don't use two different formats: either standardize on only using "atlas.xml", or standardize on only using the .def files
